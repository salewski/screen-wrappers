This is the 'BUGS' file for the 'screen-wrappers' project.

Please send all bug reports to Alan D. Salewski <salewski@att.net>

Note that some of the programs, modules, or whatever in the 'screen-wrappers'
project, (when run with a '-h' or '--help' switch, for instance, or when
viewing their documentation), may indicate that bug reports should be sent to
a particular email address. Where that email address differs from the one
above, you may be better off sending the bug to the address recommended by the
program; however, in such a case, the guidelines below may still be of
interest as they indicate the type of information that is helpful to the
developer.

When reporting a bug, please include as much information as possible,
including (but not limited to):

    * host operating system (and version)

    * version of 'screen-wrappers' project you are using

    * name of the program, file, or whatever that contains the bug

    * what the observed behavior was

    * what the expected behavior was

    * any specific steps that need to be performed in sequence in order
      to produce the bug

    * file(s) of the input that causes the buggy behavior

    * file(s) of any broken output

In short, include anything that will help us to reproduce the bug, as this
will /greatly increase/ the likelyhood of the bug getting fixed and will
/greatly decrease/ the amount of time before we can make a new release with
the bug fix.
