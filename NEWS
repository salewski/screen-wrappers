This is the 'NEWS' file for the 'screen-wrappers' project. This file contains
information on changes since the last release of the package, as well as a
running list of changes from previous versions.  If critical bugs are found in
any of the software, notice of such bugs and the versions in which they were
fixed will be noted here, as well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* screen-wrappers 0.3.2 (2016-??-??)

** fixes

*** issue #8: autotools/missing and friends updated

    https://github.com/salewski/screen-wrappers/issues/8

    This prevents these configure-time warnings:

    :    /path/to/screen-wrappers/autotools/missing: Unknown `--is-lightweight' option
    :    Try `/path/to/screen-wrappers/autotools/missing --help' for more information
    :    configure: WARNING: 'missing' script is too old or missing

*** issue #6: configure now checks for bash 4.x or newer

    https://github.com/salewski/screen-wrappers/issues/6

    The 'screen-ls' program uses associative arrays, which were introduced in
    bash-4.0. The 'configure' was previously checking for the presence of
    bash, but did not check for any particular version. The consequence was
    that it was possible to build a version of the program that did not work
    at runtime if installing on a host that only has bash 3.x (yes, the author
    came across such a thing in the wild).

    The 'configure' script now checks that the found version of bash is at
    major version 4 or newer, and bombs out with an error message if that is
    not the case.

    If you have multiple versions of bash installed on your machine, you can
    tell 'configure' where to find the one you want to use by specifying the
    'BASH_SH' variable on the 'configure' command line like this:

    :    $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/wherever BASH_SH=/path/to/your/bash-4


*** issue #7: screen-ls no longer swallows output of old versions of screen

    https://github.com/salewski/screen-wrappers/issues/7

    Prior to this fix the 'screen-ls' program was only able to parse the
    'screen -ls' output from more recent versions of GNU 'screen', and was
    swallowing all of the output from ancient versions of 'screen' that
    produced a slightly different output.

    The program was expecting to parse output in the form:

    :        28189.screen-wrappers-hacking   (06/22/2016 06:49:18 PM)        (Attached)

    but was inadvertently swallowing all of the output from older versions,
    which have the form:

    :        28189.screen-wrappers-hacking   (Attached)

    The 'screen-wrappers' author is still encountering those ancient versions
    "in the wild", so the 'screen-ls' program has been enhanced to be flexible
    enough to correctly parse both forms.

    Old format behavior tested with 'screen' 4.00.03 (FAU) 23-Oct-06.

    New format behavior tested with 'screen' 4.04.00 (GNU) 19-Jun-16.

* screen-wrappers 0.3.1 (2016-07-29)

** fixes

*** issue #5: screen-wrappers build now omits `--nobacklink` when invoking pod2html

    https://github.com/salewski/screen-wrappers/issues/5

    The `'--no-backlink'` option to `pod2html` requests what is the default
    behavior for that tool, but that command line option is not available on
    some older `pod2html` versions (such as that from perl 5.8.8) on hosts on
    which we wish to build screen-wrappers. We therefore have removed the
    option from the Makefile recipe; the resulting build is identical in
    behavior and outcome to that prior to this change, but the build is now
    able to complete successfully on a slightly wider range of machines (at
    the expense of the build recipe being slightly less explicit about the
    wanted behavior).

* screen-wrappers 0.3.0 (2016-07-04)

** fixes

   (none)


** improvements

*** README(.md) switched to GitHub-flavored markdown (from org-mode) for improved rendering on GitHub

    The content of the file was also updated to integrate better from the
    GitHub repository view (which shows the README file by default) with the
    project's GitHub Pages site.

    Also renamed the file from 'README' to 'README.md' so GitHub would
    recognize it as a markdown file.


*** issue #3: screen-ls: allow short-form command line options to be bundled

    https://github.com/salewski/screen-wrappers/issues/3

    All of the following representative invocations are now equivalent:

    :     $ screen-ls -l -p
    :     $ screen-ls -lp

    :     $ screen-ls -p -l
    :     $ screen-ls -pl

    Prior to this change, the bundled variations ('-lp' and '-pl') caused the
    program to exit with an error code.


*** issue #4: build now generates man pages in HTML format, too

    https://github.com/salewski/screen-wrappers/issues/4

    The project is now able to generate man pages in HTML format (in addition
    to the troff format man pages). This is mainly intended for use by the
    author to incorporate them into the 'screen-wrappers' project's GitHub
    Pages web site.  However, the mechanism is generic and will install the
    pages beneath a 'html' directory beneath the =htmldir= location (which can
    be specified at configure-time).

    Since this is a new capability, we have bumped up the 'm' in our M.m.p
    (semver) version number from '0.2.3' to '0.3.0'.

* screen-wrappers 0.2.2 (2016-06-22)

** fixes

*** screen-ls: minor documentation fix


*** screen-ls: fix github issue #2: name of last session name was being omitted from output when using newer versions of GNU 'screen'.

    See: https://github.com/salewski/screen-wrappers/issues/2

* screen-wrappers 0.2.1 (2016-04-10)

** fixes

*** screen-ls: address github bug #1: work correctly with GNU screen 4.3.0 or newer

    https://github.com/salewski/screen-wrappers/issues/1

    Upstream GNU screen versions prior to 4.3.0 exited with a non-zero exit
    status of 1 (rather than the expected zero status) when invoked with the
    'screen -ls' option, as is done by the 'screen-ls' program:

    http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?26750

    Earlier versions of 'screen-ls' had a comment in the source code noting
    the wonkiness, and broke with GNU screen 4.3.0 when the upstream bug
    #26750 was addressed (2015-06-12).

    The 'screen-ls' program now attempts to parse the output of 'screen
    --version' at runtime and adapt its behavior accordingly. If it detects a
    version of GNU screen older than 4.3.0, then the traditional 'screen-ls'
    behavior is used. If a version of screen newer than 4.3.0 is detected,
    then the behavior is modified to expect a zero exit status to indicate a
    successful outcome from the 'screen -ls' invocation.

* screen-wrappers 0.2.0 (2016-03-25)

This release of 'screen-wrappers' finds the project publicly hosted on GitHub
for the first time. The project's GitHub URL is:

    http://github.com/salewski/screen-wrappers

   (none)


** improvements

*** screen-ls: minor doc fixes

*** screen-ls: new '-U' (--unsorted) option

    The new '-U' (--unsorted) option prevents the program from sorting the
    output, and instead list screen sessions in order output by
    screen(1). Thanks to John Marquart for suggesting this feature.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* screen-wrappers 0.1.1 (2013-07-09)

** fixes

**** screen-ls: corrected 'screen -q -ls' exit status checking

The screen-wrappers-0.1.0 release included a version of 'screen-ls' that had
code left in that was being used by the author to verify error handling by
forcing the exception condition, with the result that the program was
unusable. Sorry! This has been corrected.


** improvements

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* screen-wrappers 0.1.0 (2013-07-09)

This is the initial release of 'screen-wrappers'.

The 'screen-wrappers' project provides convenience wrappers for various
invocations of the GNU screen(1) program.

    http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/

This initial release provides only the 'screen-ls' program. Once installed,
you can read screen-ls(1) to learn all about it.

See the README file for more information.
