** improvements

*** screen-ls: minor doc fixes

*** screen-ls: new '-U' (--unsorted) option

    The new '-U' (--unsorted) option prevents the program from sorting the
    output, and instead list screen sessions in order output by
    screen(1). Thanks to John Marquart for suggesting this feature.

* screen-wrappers 0.1.1 (2013-07-09)

** fixes

**** screen-ls: corrected 'screen -q -ls' exit status checking

The screen-wrappers-0.1.0 release included a version of 'screen-ls' that had
code left in that was being used by the author to verify error handling by
forcing the exception condition, with the result that the program was
unusable. Sorry! This has been corrected.
