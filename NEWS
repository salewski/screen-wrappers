This is the 'NEWS' file for the 'screen-wrappers' project. This file contains
information on changes since the last release of the package, as well as a
running list of changes from previous versions.  If critical bugs are found in
any of the software, notice of such bugs and the versions in which they were
fixed will be noted here, as well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* screen-wrappers 0.2.1 (2016-??-??)

** fixes

*** screen-ls: address github bug #1: work correctly with GNU screen 4.3.0 or newer

    https://github.com/salewski/screen-wrappers/issues/1

    Upstream GNU screen versions prior to 4.3.0 exited with a non-zero exit
    status of 1 (rather than the expected zero status) when invoked with the
    'screen -ls' option, as is done by the 'screen-ls' program:

    http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?26750

    Earlier versions of 'screen-ls' had a comment in the source code noting
    the wonkiness, and broke with GNU screen 4.3.0 when the upstream bug
    #26750 was addressed (2015-06-12).

    The 'screen-ls' program now attempts to parse the output of 'screen
    --version' at runtime and adapt its behavior accordingly. If it detects a
    version of GNU screen older than 4.3.0, then the traditional 'screen-ls'
    behavior is used. If a version of screen newer than 4.3.0 is detected,
    then the behavior is modified to expect a zero exit status to indicate a
    successful outcome from the 'screen -ls' invocation.

* screen-wrappers 0.2.0 (2016-03-25)

This release of 'screen-wrappers' finds the project publicly hosted on GitHub
for the first time. The project's GitHub URL is:

    http://github.com/salewski/screen-wrappers

** fixes

   (none)


** improvements

*** screen-ls: minor doc fixes

*** screen-ls: new '-U' (--unsorted) option

    The new '-U' (--unsorted) option prevents the program from sorting the
    output, and instead list screen sessions in order output by
    screen(1). Thanks to John Marquart for suggesting this feature.

* screen-wrappers 0.1.1 (2013-07-09)

** fixes

**** screen-ls: corrected 'screen -q -ls' exit status checking

The screen-wrappers-0.1.0 release included a version of 'screen-ls' that had
code left in that was being used by the author to verify error handling by
forcing the exception condition, with the result that the program was
unusable. Sorry! This has been corrected.


** improvements

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* screen-wrappers 0.1.0 (2013-07-09)

This is the initial release of 'screen-wrappers'.

The 'screen-wrappers' project provides convenience wrappers for various
invocations of the GNU screen(1) program.

This initial release provides only the 'screen-ls' program. Once installed,
you can read screen-ls(1) to learn all about it.

See the README file for more information.
