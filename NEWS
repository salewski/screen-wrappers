**** screen-ls: corrected 'screen -q -ls' exit status checking

The screen-wrappers-0.1.0 release included a version of 'screen-ls' that had
code left in that was being used by the author to verify error handling by
forcing the exception condition, with the result that the program was
unusable. Sorry! This has been corrected.
